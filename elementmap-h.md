# postfixNamer.h  Header file

The goal here is to create a common place for the consts and other elements used by toponaming as a whole.

I recommend we also go ahead and move `elementMapPrefix` to a const as it simply returns a semicolon (always).

Later, this will also be the header file for postfixNamer.cpp
